  "Description": "The wonderfully crazy molecular gastronomists of the world like Ferran Adria and Heston Blumenthal believe that food shouldn’t just be experienced through the sense of taste. For them it’s an all immersive experience. At Heston’s restaurant you even plug earphones into a shell to listen to the sound of the sea whilst you eat! It might not be for everyone but the easiest way to add another sensory dimension to dinnertime is to add some texture. And nothing does it quite as well as a bit of crunchiness. Hence tonight’s little number ;-)",

  "Description": "Japanese food can be pretty dangerous stuff. For thrill seekers out there, Fugu is a well-known delicacy which, if prepared incorrectly, can kill a rhinoceros within minutes. Chefs train for years to prepare the fish in just the right way, but they always leave just enough poison on each piece to numb the lips. Apparently diners enjoy the brush with death. We’re glad to say that teriyaki is neither dangerous, nor will it take you years to master.",

Taking the warming Arabic flavour of Ras-el Hanout and mixing it with lemon and apricot, this dish is as healthy as it is tasty. With sweet potatoes and carrots you’ll also be getting two of your five a day, so it’s a perfect nutritional boost for a day in the desert, or a night with your feet up.",

  "Description": "Anthropomorphisation. It’s not a word you hear all that much. It’s used to describe a situation in which we describe an object as if it had human character traits*. Though virtue is more usually associated with someone like Mother Theresa than a humble curry, bear with us here. This recipe combines all the delicious flavours of a Thai yellow curry but with all the goodness of brown rice, vegetables and even low fat coconut milk. Devilishly good has never been so saintly ;-)",

  "Description": "Japanese food can be pretty dangerous stuff. For thrill seekers out there, Fugu is a well-known delicacy which, if prepared incorrectly, can kill a rhinoceros within minutes. Chefs train for years to prepare the fish in just the right way, but they always leave just enough poison on each piece to numb the lips. Apparently diners enjoy the brush with death. We’re glad to say that teriyaki is neither dangerous, nor will it take you years to master.",

  "Description": "An impressive title for an equally impressive recipe! Legend has it that before battle Hercules would stride into his kitchen and whip up a plate of this pasta to fuel his heroics. Since it was practically ready in the time it takes to cook the pasta, it meant he never missed the start of battle and firmly secured his place in the history books. Admittedly it’s difficult to imagine the son of Zeus in a pinny, but you wouldn’t catch us making fun of him.",

He added chocolate (a big flavour in South American savoury cooking) and star anise.

This time sous chef Rachel stepped up to the plate and created something a little more traditional. Patrick had to (begrudgingly) admit that it was one of the best he’d ever tasted. Arriba!",

  "Description": "Head chef Patrick doesn’t like fuss. He’s always telling us that the best kind of food is simple, soulful grub that makes you feel loved. That said, every dinner is a chance to practise your presentation skills. Bigger plates are a great way of framing your food and a sprinkle of herbs or a drizzle of olive oil at the end gives everything a bit more pizazz. For this recipe, we took classic Mexican ingredients and played with the presentation to create something that’s as tasty to the eye as it is to the tongue. Arriba!",

  "Description": "Somedays you want to be adventurous and others you just want a little more time to put your feet up. We made this dish with classic Italian notions of simplicity and speed at its heart. To make this recipe, fresh tomatoes are left for around ten days in the sun and lose around 90% of their water to become sun-dried. The process intensifies their flavour so that even a couple will add a burst of sweet, intense flavour to your dinner. Buon appetito!",

Our top tips are: 1) take your steak out of the fridge an hour before you plan to cook it, so that it comes nearer to room temperature 2) get your pan really hot before cooking and 3)\nonce you’ve cooked it, leave it to rest for a few minutes before slicing.

They came all the way over from Italy to say hello and as you can imagine they’re pretty feisty when it comes to talking pasta. All of their pasta is made using bronze dies (i.e. it’s squeezed through a bronze pasta shaper) rather than Teflon. It’s a much longer process than cheaper producers use, but it means the sauce sticks to the pasta properly when you mix it. Our tip: Don’t even get them started on the subject of adding olive oil to your boiling water - touchy subject!",

We’re expecting Photo of the Week on Facebook to come from this recipe as it’s so photogenic!",

One day he ducked out of his palace to eat in a local restaurant where the chef served him a dish of beautifully chopped up, quickly stir fried ingredients. The governor was so impressed with the dish (not least because it was easy for him to eat) that he hired the chef full time and christened the recipe with his official name, Kung Bao. Though some people doubt the story we’re convinced it’s the tooth.*\n*Sorry, we couldn’t resist that one.",

Case in point: Chicken Paillard. To the uninitiated, this may sound like the preserve of the French aristocracy. In reality, it's just a really simple cooking method saving you time and leaving your chicken nice and tender. We've accompanied it with a classic mix of parsley, lemon zest and garlic, but if you think that sounds too simple, you can always chef things up a bit and call it a 'gremolata' ;-)",

Chefs train for years to prepare the fish in just the right way, but they always leave just enough poison on each piece to numb the lips. Apparently diners enjoy the brush with death. We’re glad to say that teriyaki is neither dangerous, nor will it take you years to master. Gambatte! \n(That means “go for it!” in Japanese)",

Luckily they see eye to eye on pretty much everything, except for peas. Patrick loves peas. The mere mention of them puts a twinkle in his eye. But Luke knows that every time they appear in a recipe, he’ll be spending the best part of his week shelling them. When he tasted these fishcakes though, his taste buds made the decision for him.

Combined with the deliciously sweet butternut squash and a whole host of mouthwatering ingredients, this really is a winning recipe.",

  "Description": "Head chef Patrick doesn’t like fuss. He’s always telling us that the best kind of food is simple, soulful grub that makes you feel loved. That said, every dinner is a chance to practise your presentation skills. Bigger plates are a great way of framing your food and a sprinkle of herbs or a drizzle of olive oil at the end gives everything a bit more pizazz. For this recipe, we took classic Mexican ingredients and played with the presentation to create something that’s as tasty to the eye as it is to the tongue. Arriba!",

  "Description": "Not so long ago dinner time used to be a very solitary occasion. Everybody had their own plate of food and woe betide anyone who should try to steal a potato from someone else’s plate. Slowly but surely our experiences of foreign cuisine warmed us up to the idea of ‘sharing food’ and nowadays it’s all the rage. With that in mind we put together this healthy chicken fajita dish with a DIY element added for a bit more fun (and ultimately a lot less work!). Remember: sharing is caring :-)",

Protein-rich, spiced chickpeas are layered with fresh, raw vegetables and herbs, all held together with a little melted cheddar. Although not Indian in any way, the deep savoury flavour of cheddar goes surprisingly well with Indian food! The red onions are quick-pickled in fresh lemon juice, resulting in gorgeously coloured, super-easy and speedy pickled onions. So you can have lovely pickled onions ready whenever you need them. Any leftovers can be tossed together and served the next day as Indian ‘panzanella’.",

During his office time instead of eating with the lawyers at lunchtime he’d nip over to a nearby food hall and feast with all the locals. Massaman Rice was his go-to dish, so this week he decided to take a trip down memory lane.",

  "Description": "What’s so special about ‘special’ fried rice? From what we can tell, not much. That’s why Patrick decided to put the ‘spesh’ back in with this nutritious plate of deliciousness. Pistachios, cashews and sesame all combine to give you a hit of heart-healthy crunch, whilst brown rice provides that wonderful chewiness to leave you feeling utterly satisfied. Mix this with the freshness of beans and pepper, it’s probably the most special rice we’ve ever tasted.",

To make this recipe, fresh tomatoes are left for around ten days in the sun and lose around 90% of their water to become sun-dried. The process intensifies their flavour so that even a couple will add a burst of sweet, intense flavour to your dinner. Buon appetito!",

Italians broadly fall into two camps: the flippers and the stirrers (our terminology not theirs). Some argue that a risotto must be constantly massaged to develop its creaminess, whilst others (the head chef at the Bulgari hotel in Milan for one) advocate flipping the rice in the pan whilst cooking. We’ve gone for stirring as there is less chance of covering the walls, but flip it if you dare!",

With a good kick of chilli it’s just the ticket for a windy weeknight. ‘Onion textures’ sound a little more posh than they need to - it essentially means some nice crunchy onions to add a bit of textural contrast to your dal. To get them good and crispy, get the oil nice and hot and don’t overcrowd the pan. If they have a bit of space to cook then you’ll fry them (instead of stew them), which will give you a perfect finish. Enjoy!",

The scale measures the amount of ‘capsaicin’ in the chilli, (the bit that makes it spicy). At the top of the scale, you’ve got the Trinidad Moruga Scorpion Chilli (!) at 2,000,000 Scoville Units, whilst the jalapeño (star of this recipe) is only 3,500 Units. However, if you’re sensitive to heat we still recommend you go easy on the spice!",

The trick is to chop the chorizo nice and fine at the start. We recommend placing your fingers on the top of your knife towards the tip and using this as a pivot while you chop up and down.

Amongst the bad ones are those that sit there innocuously on your plate, not saying boo to a goose, but loaded with enough chilli to take down a rhino.As for the ugly, you need only go to the local take-away. For this Thai Massaman rice we combined the creaminess of peanut butter (our secret ingredient!) and organic coconut milk with the fresh tanginess of coriander and lime. It’s so good it should be made a saint!",

In the more heady days of his youth, Head Chef Patrick was particularly fond of a little Spanish eatery in Borough Market, where the food and the opportunity to try out a bit of foreign lingo always seemed to impress. He ended up going there so often that eventually he became best friends with the head chef and started to work in the kitchen at weekends. His favourite recipes included the beautiful Iberican combination of prawns and chorizo, which he uses here so that you can have date-night at home!",

Olive oil is crazy good for you due to its sky high antioxidant levels (found in its phenolic compounds) and omega-9 content. Omega-9 is one of the “good fats” everyone speaks of, with a plethora of health benefits. Olive oil is 85% good fat so tuck in!!!",

Always mix your meatball ingredients with your hands rather than a spoon. This lighter touch allows all the ingredients to be incorporated without damaging the meat - you don’t want to form a paste! Secondly, when forming your meatballs don’t compact the meat too tightly. It helps to oil your hands before you form your balls so that the mixture does not stick and you can gently and quickly form the balls.",

This dish also has a delicious flavour profile with zingy, minty yoghurt and hints of sweetness from the dried apricot.",

With a good kick of chilli it’s just the ticket for a windy weeknight. ‘Onion textures’ sound a little more posh than they need to - it just means some nice crunchy onions to add a bit of textural contrast to your dal. To make them really crispy, get the oil nice and hot and don’t overcrowd the pan. If they have a bit of space to cook then they'll fry well (instead of stewing), which will give you a perfect finish. Enjoy!",

By making a hollow in the middle of the burger it helps the meat cook evenly, maintaining its shape as it shrinks during cooking!",

Break it up into mince and use as the basis of a pasta sauce or roll it into meatballs (cheatballs!). In this recipe it makes a banger of a burger. Popping a lid on the pan while you cook them (see the tip in Step 6) keeps everything super juicy and gives you perfectly melted cheese.",

Don't neglect what the Italians call 'tostatura': cooking the rice in oil before adding stock. It takes only a minute but makes all the difference. Enjoy!",

Using the starch in rice cooking water to thicken a sauce is a also a neat trick. Enjoy!",
